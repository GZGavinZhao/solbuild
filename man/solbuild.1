.SH "NAME"
\fBsolbuild\fR \- Solus package builder
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsolbuild [subcommand] <flags>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsolbuild(1)\fR is a \fBchroot(2)\fR based package build system, used to safely and efficiently build Solus packages from source\.
.P
\fBsolbuild(1)\fR makes use of \fBOverlayFS\fR to provide a simple caching system, whereby a base image (provided by the Solus project) is used as the bottom\-most, read\-only layer, and changes are made in temporary upper layers\.
.P
When building \fBpackage\.yml\fR files (\fBypkg\fR), the tool will also disable all networking within the environment, apart from the loopback device\. This is intended to prevent uncontrolled build environments in which a package may be fetching external, unverified sources, during the build\.
.P
This behaviour can be turned off on a package basis, by setting the \fBnetworking\fR key to \fBtrue\fR within the YML file\. This should only be used when it is completely unavoidable, however, as the container mechanism is there for a reason\. Trust\.
.P
With both build types, legacy and \fBypkg\fR, the tool will enter an isolated namespace using the \fBunshare(2)\fR system call\. It intends to provide a highly controlled build environment, and providing a robust container in which to build packages intended for use in production\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options apply to all subcommands within \fBsolbuild(1)\fR\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Help provides an explanation for any command or subcommand\. Without any specified subcommands it will list the main subcommands for the application\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-color\fR
.IP
Disable text colourisation in the output from \fBsolbuild\fR and all child processes\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-profile\fR
.IP
Set the build configuration profile to use with all operations\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
.IP
Enable extra logging messages with debug level, useful to assist in further introspection of the environment setup and teardown\.\.
.IP "" 0
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
\fBbuild [package\.yml] | [pspec\.xml]\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Build the given package in a chroot environment, and upon success,
store those packages in the current directory\.

If you do not pass a package file as an argument to `build`, it will look
for the files in the current working directory\. The priority is always given
to `package\.yml` files, falling back to `pspec\.xml`, the legacy build format\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tmpfs\fR:
.IP "" 4
.nf
 Instruct `solbuild(1)` to use a `tmpfs` mount as the bottom most point
 in the chroot layer system\. This can drastically improve build times,
 as most of the changes are happening purely in memory\. If running on
 a memory constrained device, please consider setting an appropriate
 upper constraint\. See the next flag for more details\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Set the contraint size for `tmpfs` mounts used by `solbuild(1)`\. This is
only useful in conjunction with the `\-t` option\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "" 0
.P
\fBchroot [package\.yml] | [pspec\.xml]\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Interactively chroot into the package\'s build environment, to enable
further inspection when issues aren\'t immediately resolvable, i\.e\. pkg\-config
dependencies\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
\fBdelete\-cache\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Delete all of the build roots under `/var/cache/solbuild`\. Although `solbuild(1)`
employs many cache efficient methods in which to save on space and time, we
retain the build roots after builds to allow inspection and chrooting\.

Using this command will remove ALL roots from the cache\. You should ensure
you are not already running any builds whilst calling this command, as it may
lead to undefined behaviour\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
In addition to deleting the build root caches, the packages, sources,
and ccache/sccache (compiler) caches will also be purged from disk\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "" 0
.P
\fBindex [directory]\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Use the given build profile to construct a repository index in the
given directory\. If a directory is not specified, then the current directory
is used\. This directory will be mounted inside the container and the Solus
machinery will be used to create a repository\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tmpfs\fR:
.IP "" 4
.nf
 Instruct `solbuild(1)` to use a `tmpfs` mount as the bottom most point
 in the chroot layer system\. This can help to speed up indexing of large
 repositories\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Set the contraint size for `tmpfs` mounts used by `solbuild(1)`\. This is
only useful in conjunction with the `\-t` option\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "" 0
.P
\fBinit\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Initialise a solbuild profile so that it can be used for subsequent
builds\. You must perform this step if you wish to do any kind of useful
operations with `solbuild(1)`\.

The init command respects the global `\-\-profile` option, however you
may pass the name of the profile as an argument instead if you wish\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-update\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Passing the update flag will cause `solbuild(1)` to automatically update
the base image, after it has successfully initialised it\.
.fi
.IP "" 0

.IP "" 0
.P
\fBupdate [profile]\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Update the base image of the specified solbuild profile, helping to
minimize the build times in future updates with this profile\.

The update command respects the global `\-\-profile` option, however you
may pass the name of the profile as an argument instead if you wish\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
\fBversion\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
Print the version and copyright notice of `solbuild(1)` and exit\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success, 0 is returned\. A non\-zero return code signals a failure\.
